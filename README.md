### Greetings, fellow coders! I'm Ihor, a code wizard from Kyiv 🧙‍♂️

I love to conjure up amazing and useful applications, using a variety of spells and potions (also known as technologies and programming languages).

- ⚡ Fun fact:
- 🔭 I'm currently brewing a magic potion for backend development, using Node.js and MongoDB & Mongoose as my ingredients
- 🌱 I'm currently learning the secrets of Node.js and MongoDB, to cast powerful spells in backend development
- 👯 I want to join forces with other code wizards who share my passion for coding and learning
- 🤔 I'm looking for guidance on the mysteries of the Universe
- 💬 Ask me anything about coding, I'll be glad to share my wisdom and experience
